All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Smart context pruning: memories ranked by relevance to the current task description
- Command result caching in batch_execute (60s TTL) — identical commands served from cache
- Session warm-up: CLAUDE.md, git log, directory tree, and config files indexed at SessionStart
- Cache hit counter in stats output

### Improved
- Deduplication of decisions and files before context injection
- Large command output auto-summarized before indexing (keeps KB lean)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- `/brain-remember <text>` — manually store rules and conventions that get injected into every future teammate
- `/brain-forget <text>` — remove a manually stored memory by partial text match
- `/brain-export` — distill all accumulated brain knowledge into a committable `CONVENTIONS.md` file
- Manual memories shown as "Project Rules & Conventions" section in teammate context (before team decisions)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- `/brain-update` skill — pull the latest version from GitHub without reinstalling
- Version check on `SessionStart` — non-intrusive hint when a new version is available
- Token-efficient tool guidance injected into every subagent on spawn (`batch_execute`, `search`, `execute`, `index`)
- Skill files for all user commands: `brain-status`, `brain-query`, `brain-runs`, `brain-clear`
- First-run welcome message on cold start (empty brain)
- `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability reporting process
- GitHub Actions CI — validates JSON, lints shell scripts, checks Python syntax, enforces version consistency

### Fixed
