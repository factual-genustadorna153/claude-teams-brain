**Persistent cross-session memory for Claude Code Agent Teams.**

Claude Code's Agent Teams are powerful — but ephemeral. Every teammate spawns with a blank slate. Every session forgets what the last one built. claude-teams-brain fixes this by automatically indexing everything your team produces and injecting role-specific memory into every new teammate the moment they spawn.

Your AI team gets smarter with every session. No extra prompting. No manual context copying. No more starting from zero.

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+, Node.js 18+, Claude Code v2.1+

### 1. Install the plugin

In Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Gr122lyBr/claude-teams-brain
/plugin install claude-teams-brain@claude-teams-brain
```

### 2. Enable Agent Teams

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

If `settings.json` already has content, merge the `env` block:

```json
{
  "someExistingSetting": true,
  "env": {
    "YOUR_EXISTING_VAR": "value",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code after saving.

### 3. Configure CLAUDE.md (recommended)

Add to your project's `CLAUDE.md` to make Claude automatically use Agent Teams:

```markdown
## Agent Teams

Always use agent teams for tasks that can be parallelized across concerns.
Spawn specialized teammates with role-specific names rather than doing everything
in a single session. Good team structures:

- Feature work: `backend`, `frontend`, `tests`
- Reviews: `security`, `performance`, `coverage`
- Architecture: `architect`, `devil-advocate`, `implementer`
- Debugging: name teammates after the hypothesis they're testing

The claude-teams-brain plugin is active — each teammate will automatically receive
memory from past sessions relevant to their role.
```

---

## Why this matters

Agent Teams introduced true multi-agent parallelism to Claude Code — teammates that communicate directly, own separate file scopes, and collaborate without a single-session bottleneck. But they have one fundamental weakness:

> *Teammates exist for the duration of a session and then they're gone. No persistent identity, no memory across sessions, no `/resume`.*

This creates a compounding problem on real projects. Your backend agent spent two hours establishing architecture decisions, learning your conventions, and building the auth system. Tomorrow, a new backend agent spawns and rediscovers everything from scratch — making inconsistent decisions, touching files already settled, asking questions already answered.

claude-teams-brain solves this at the infrastructure level. It hooks into the Agent Teams lifecycle, indexes every task completion, file change, and architectural decision, and injects the relevant history directly into each new teammate's context before they write a single line of code.

---

## How it works

claude-teams-brain hooks into six lifecycle events:

| Hook | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| `SessionStart` | Brain initializes, reports how much memory exists for this project |
| `SubagentStart` | ⭐ Role-specific memory injected directly into each new teammate |
| `TaskCompleted` | Task subject and agent identity indexed immediately on completion |
| `SubagentStop` | Rich indexing: files touched, decisions made, output summary extracted from transcript |
| `TeammateIdle` | Passive checkpoint |
| `SessionEnd` | Full session compressed into a summary entry |

The `SubagentStart` hook is the core mechanism. When a teammate named `backend` spawns, the brain queries everything the backend agent has done across all past sessions — tasks completed, files owned, decisions made — and injects it as context before the agent processes its first message. The teammate starts informed, not blank.

All data lives in `~/.claude-teams-brain/projects/<project-hash>/brain.db` — a local SQLite database. Nothing is sent anywhere. No external dependencies beyond Python 3.8+ stdlib.

---

## MCP Tools

claude-teams-brain includes an MCP server that exposes five tools to all Task subagents. These tools keep large command output out of context windows by indexing it into a session knowledge base and returning only relevant search results.

### batch_execute

Run multiple shell commands, auto-index all output, and search with queries in a single call.

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {"label": "git log", "command": "git log --oneline -20"},
    {"label": "test results", "command": "npm test 2>&1"}
  ],
  "queries": ["recent commits about auth", "failing tests"],
  "timeout": 60000
}
```

### search

Search the session knowledge base built by previous batch_execute or index calls.

```json
{
  "queries": ["authentication middleware", "error handling patterns"],
  "limit": 3
}
```

### index

Manually index content (findings, analysis, data) for later retrieval.

```json
{
  "content": "The auth module uses RS256 JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry...",
  "source": "auth-analysis"
}
```

### execute

Run code in a sandboxed subprocess. Set `intent` to auto-index and search large output.

```json
{
  "language": "python",
  "code": "import ast; print(ast.dump(ast.parse(open('main.py').read())))",
  "timeout": 30000,
  "intent": "find all class definitions"
}
```

Supported languages: `shell`, `javascript`, `python`.

### stats

Show session context savings metrics.

```json
{}
```

Returns bytes indexed vs bytes returned, call counts, and context savings ratio.

## Usage

Once installed, the brain works silently in the background. Just use Agent Teams normally.

**First session (cold start):**
```
You: Create an agent team to build the payments module.
     backend: API endpoints and business logic
     database: schema and migrations
     tests: integration test coverage

[Agent Teams session runs — claude-teams-brain indexes everything]
```

**Second session (warm start):**
```
You: Create an agent team to add webhook support to payments.
     backend: extend the existing payment API

[backend agent spawns and immediately receives:]
  "## 🧠 claude-teams-brain: Memory for role [backend]
   
   ### Your Past Work
   - Built payment API endpoints in /src/payments/api.ts
   - Implemented idempotency key validation middleware
   
   ### Key Team Decisions
   - [database] Using UUID v7 for all payment record IDs
   - [backend] Chose RS256 over HS256 for JWT — better key rotation
   - [backend] All payment endpoints require idempotency keys
   
   ### Files You Own
   - /src/payments/api.ts
   - /src/payments/middleware/idempotency.ts"
```

The teammate starts with full context from day one.

## Memory storage

```
~/.claude-teams-brain/
  └── projects/
      └── <project-hash>/
          └── brain.db    ← SQLite, one file per project
```

Each project has its own isolated brain. Memory never crosses project boundaries. The SQLite file is fully inspectable with any database viewer.

---

## Tips

- **Use descriptive agent names** that match their role (`backend`, `database`, `security`) — the brain routes memory by role name
- **Memory compounds** — the first session is cold, but quality improves significantly from the second session onwards
- **Check `/claude-teams-brain:brain-status`** before starting a large session to confirm memory is available
- **Run `/claude-teams-brain:brain-query backend`** to preview exactly what context the backend agent will receive before spawning
